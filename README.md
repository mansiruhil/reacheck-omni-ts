**ReaCheck**

a cross platform game based app that tests and trains users to detect AI generated content. The app presents headlines, images, quotes, reviews and even text messages - some real, some AI generated and users have to guess which is which. Behind the scenes, we use LLMs (like GPT or open source models) to generate fake but convincing content. The app adjusts difficulty by analyzing the userâ€™s accuracy using lightweight NLP scoring models. Age based modes make it accessible for kids, teens, adults and even elderly users. The project aims to boost AI literacy through gamified learning and can scale into educational and enterprise versions. Bonus features: streaks, leaderboards and community challenges.
